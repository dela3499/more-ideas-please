- get enter/return keycode to trigger AddItem
- setup code to track focus (necessary for accurately triggering AddItem)
- animation to show when a list is added
- hide items when there there aren't any
- clear inputs after saving list or adding item
- improve intro text
- remove intro image
- change model so editList is List', rather than a special type, then add an item field to the model. (So you don't need a separate case for current and new lists)
- fix desktop styles
- Add error messages and validation - i.e. needs a name, and at least one item per list.
